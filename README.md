# UIKit Extra Widths
This package allows you to include the extra columns into uikit, specifically adding back in some widths that were removed from UIKit3 that many found useful.

## Disclaimer:
This package is completely based off https://alekvolsk.pw/jed/uikit-grid-width/

## Installation
You can install this via yarn/npm using `npm install uikit3-extra-widths --save-dev` or `yarn add uikit3-extra-widths`

Once included you can then import it into your entry css file. e.g using Sass

```css
@import "node_modules/uikit3-extra-widths/uikit3/width-ex";
```

## Usage
As you normally would use any width component by simply using the new sizing e.g `uk-width-1-10`
